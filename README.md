# QuikPik
What should I do tonight?
A question that has long plauged humanity. What should I do? Where should I go? How should I spend my precious time?

QuikPiks seeks to provide an answer to our indecision through advanced technology.

Perhaps you have two options to choose between and need fate to step in in the form of a coin toss. Perhaps you need random chance to choose between multiple options? Or maybe you have no idea at all and need something to make a choice for you. That's where QuikPiks steps in.

You have the option between the cold logical randomness of a computer or the wisdom of the crowd by means of voting. 

## User Story

-As a user I want to have a web app make decisions for me.
-When I provide my options for what I can do I want the app to decide which option I should choose.
-When I provide my options for a vote I want other users to vote on what I should do and be provided the results of the vote.
-When I login I want the option to vote on someone elses possible choices.
-I want the app to save my preferences and my previous decisions for future reference.
