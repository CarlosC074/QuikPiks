# QuikPik
What should I do tonight?
A question that has long plauged humanity. What should I do? Where should I go? How should I spend my precious time?

QuikPiks seeks to provide an answer to our indecision through advanced technology.

Perhaps you have two options to choose between and need fate to step in in the form of a coin toss. Perhaps you need random chance to choose between multiple options? Or maybe you have no idea at all and need something to make a choice for you. That's where QuikPiks steps in.
